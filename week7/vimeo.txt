	Vimeo is a pretty popular site because it is so user friendly. The user experience is great because everything is pretty intuitive and fluid. I have not personally used Vimeo but people I have done group work with in my courses, have used it and had no problems. I use it to look through videos because it is almost like a YouTube, and has a lot of videos on it. I like how the homepage acquaints the user with the purpose of the site. 
	I appreciate how it is organized and explains to the user why their site is better than others. They explain to the users that no prior technology knowledge is needed to understand the site. This creates a feeling of comfort and users relax after reading this. The navigation makes sense and is easy to get from place to another.
