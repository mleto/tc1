	I am confused as to what this even is. I have never been directed here on my iPhone, I cannot imagine that is it used a lot. It is a good idea to get an application going for the school but I do not think this should be the direction of design they should be going for since no one I know uses this "MSU Mobile". 
	The icons are great however they are not centered and do not fill up the page. There is a lot of gray space and the home page is poorly layer out. There is not an description or feeling of knowing what should be going on with this main page. As a user I am confused as to what I would be using this application for because the first thing I see when coming to the site is several different categories. The search bar is convenient however it does not pull up the most popular searches. There is a plethora of content within this application that could benefit MSU student's but it is not easily navigable. The pages are rather direct and there is a lot of  information within all of them. I feel like it would be better to have more information on a single page rather than snippets of information across several pages.
