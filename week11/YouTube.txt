	As far as often accessed websites from my iPhone, I would consider YouTube as my most popular visited site. After opening Safari and browsing my last 5 webpages I had open, 3 of which were YouTube videos I had played while running and out at a part with friends. It is not their phone application I am talking about, but their site from my web browser on my iPhone. 
	It is relatively convenient to use, I do not have problems figuring out where to search for a video and everything seemingly makes sense. The purpose of the website is to search and listen to music and they have made that easy with their website. Once a user searches for a video, the video pulls up and covers half of the screen which makes clicking on it easy because your finger will cover the entire button and plus sometimes people will actually want to watch the video without having to enlarge the screen. When the video is pulled up, there is not a whole lot of content that overbears the user. There is just the video, which as I said, covers half the screen, then suggested videos underneath , then as the header there is an icon to bring you back to the home screen and another icon to search for more videos. 
	Overall the website is straightforward making it easy to use. Having the minimal amount of icons on the page, with the video as big as it is, gives the user everything that it needs, which is essentially an icon to search for videos and the screen of the video, as big as it is.
