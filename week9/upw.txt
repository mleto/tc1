	United Pixelworkers is a simply designed site. The colors are black, gray, and red. The main shapes are square and the font is nothing special. That being said, the lay out is kind of confused. No everything is the same size and I am not sure why because it is not aesthetically pleasing. The squares that appear next to the shirts do not provide an explanation put just give seemingly random information about the shirt. The site does not explain what it is. It just kind of throws everything on the home page. 
	It needs to be better organized. Similar things need to be grouped together. The category on the navigation bar is not clear and when I scroll down the page, the right side turns blank. To make it less awkward, the category menu on the right could follow as the user scrolls down. Another issue is  the navigation titles at the top do not stretch across the whole screen. As well as the quote or explanation underneath it, it could be spaced so that it went across the whole top of the page rather than just stick to one side. Also, the footer is too big and does not fit with the rest of the site.
