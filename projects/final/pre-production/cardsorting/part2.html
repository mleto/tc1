        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <h4>With our final project being our personal site, I want to make it as great as possible. A part of working in our field is creating design that flows and feels natural and makes sense. I wanted to make sure my website gave the feel to all of the participants. It helpful that we are working on something in this class that I can actually use in the future. Hopefully I can get the design right and be able to use it in the future </h4>

        <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Overall I was expecting to get more agreement on what made the most sense. Since no one can create something where everything is perfect, of course there is going to be some disagreement on what belongs where. This site was very helpful in helping me figure out what belons where</p>
