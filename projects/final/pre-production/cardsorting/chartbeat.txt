	This site is really interactive and has a complimentary color palette. Everything is a shade of blue, at least almost everything except the red accent color. In one long sentence Chartbeat explained there goal and what they do. This is something users appreciate because they do not have to figure out for themselves what the objective of the site is. This makes the site very professional and well put together. A lot of time and effort was dedicated to the design and overflow and it pays off. 
	The site is engaging for multiple different reasons. There is a counter on the home page that goes up every second and counts the number of people that have visited the site. There is just enough on the page to keep the user interested but overwhelmed. From the text, to the buttons, to the graphics, there is a good amount of each that keeps the user in tuned with what they are trying to say. 
	However, that is not to say that once a user scrolls down that they do not get overwhelmed. I am a little weary of the home page because I would rather have tabs at the top then have multiple pages towards the bottom of the page. The transition from page to page is not that fluid and does not make a whole lot of sense to me.
