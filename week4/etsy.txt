	Etsy is a great place to find products that can not be found in conventional stores. Offering handmade and vintage items, they are an e-commerce website unlike most others. They have products ranging from fine jewelry to home decor, giving users a wide variety of different types of products. All vintage items are at least 20 years old and sellers list their goods for a fee of $0.20. 
	The site is relatively navigable. It has a relatively simple set up where there are lots of tabs on the left hand side listing the different categories of products and a home screen that brings up some valuable items. Looking at the home screen, the items that are listed are "Handpicked Items" that are "picked by B H". When clicking on B H you see that B H stands for Brooke Howie who is a seller and it links to her item collection that is called "A Beautiful Thingâ€¦..". All of this is unnecessary and only confuses the user and distracts from their main task at hand. People come to Etsy with a specific product in mind and do not care to have random items on their home feed that are completely irrelevant to the item that they came to the site for. It makes more sense if Etsy pulled from the users most recent purchases and built a home screen based off of past purchases. Also, the way that sellers tag their collections/items is inefficient. Users can search for a product and if it is not typed in correctly then they are missing out on a lot of potential buys. In other words, their search engine optimization is too specific and not broad enough to show all of the products the user may be interested in.
