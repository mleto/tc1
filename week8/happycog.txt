	I appreciate the simplicity of this site. The color scheme is pleasing to the eye and it is easy to focus in on one thing which I appreciate. It is user friendly in the sense that the color scheme allows for the user to focus on the content and not get overwhelmed. The details in the choice of color shows how much effort the designers put into every color choice. The bright color scheme not only makes it aesthetically appealing but also piques the readers interest. Nothing about this site is boring. The font that they use is great as well as the way the did the logo. 
	As far as the content goes, the user is really thought about. It is geared towards creating a great experience for the user. It is easily navigable and makes the user feel natural and easy. From the design to the content, it's theme of simplicity runs throughout. From the beginning it is understood, what the site is about, and the user easily comprehends the mission of the site. There is not a lot of content, and it is all very concise. The site balances the design and content to create a simply beautiful site.
