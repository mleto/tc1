<h2>Panic.com Critique</h2>
<p>At first glane, Panic.com has large graphics that take up the entire browser page. They use bright colors that catch the users eyes but from a design standpoint there is no flow to the webpage and it is not entirely clear what the website does. Everytime you go to a new icon, it looks like you go to a continuously new site. There is no continuity and they do not have a great way for users to navigate it. </p>
<p>They could make the icons smaller so that all of their products fit on the intial page without scrolling. They could also remove the triangle graphic at the bottom of the home screen because it does nothing for the page but distract the user or the reader. Altogether is they made the navigability better and created a better design that made more sense, it could be a better site. </p>
