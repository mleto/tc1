	I like the layout of MSU's website. It is not nearly as bad as it used to be when I was an incoming freshmen. The website then was confusing and hard to navigate. I am excited that they re-designed it! I am sure that it took quite some time to re do it all considering the amount of information that the site has. The best part of the overall design is the main home picture because it is a great focal point. 
	At the same time, there is a ton of information on the site and I think it could be focused and organized a bit better. Although the navigation bar provides tabs for users to search for whatever it is they are looking for, I think the design could be more simplistic. I see that they are trying to make the site very interesting but for most visitors, they are on the site because they need to get something accomplished. It is not a shopping site where viewers want to browse products, it is a place where students come to obtain information and because of that it's design definitely needs to be sleek and simple. I think it could do without All of the different tabs at the bottom such as MSU View, MSU News, Events, MSU Talk and the two ads at the bottom. Overall the design has improved from the last time I have been on the site, with a few alterations it could be even better!
